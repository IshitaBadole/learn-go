// While studying Go, I came across this changelog email (https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4t3lzH3I0eI), 
// This got me curious about what proxy bypassing means, what a zone ID is and how link-local IPv6 addresses work.
// I hadnâ€™t explored low-level networking in Go before, so I wanted to understand this better.
//
// This program is the result of that curiosity. With help from ChatGPT, I wrote this to:
//   - Iterate over all network interfaces on the system.
//   - Skip interfaces that are down.
//   - For active interfaces, inspect their assigned addresses.
//   - Filter and print only IPv6 link-local unicast addresses (addresses that start with fe80::).
//   - Print them in the format `fe80::1%en0`, where `en0` is the interface name,
//     used to disambiguate between interfaces since link-local addresses are not globally unique.
//
// Writing and debugging this helped me understand net.Interfaces(), bitmask flags like FlagUp, type assertions
// in Go, and how IPv6 link-local addressing and zone identifiers are used in practice.

		// Check if the interface is down by checking if its FlagUp flag is unset (== 0)
		// skip the interface if it is down or not configured

			continue

				// In link-local addresses, an address can be used in multiple places so the interface is specified
				// First %s -> the IP address
